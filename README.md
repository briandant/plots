# Reqs

- I can add an item to the Gantt planning chart via the command line
- Each item merely needs a preceding element id as its parent
- and a duration
- if the item does not have a parent, it as assumed not to be on the critical path
- if the item is not on the critical path, it needs a start date
- list the items that are not valid should be listed somewhere near the chart
